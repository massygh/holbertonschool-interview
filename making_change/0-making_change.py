Compute the fewest number of coins needed to reach a given total.

Prototype: def makeChange(coins, total)
- Return the fewest number of coins needed to meet total
- If total is 0 or less, return 0
- If total cannot be met by any number of coins you have, return -1
- coins is a list of the values of the coins in your possession
- You can assume you have an infinite number of each denomination
